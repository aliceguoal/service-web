User studies done in lab environments are frequently insufficient to understand the real-world interactions between user context, environmental factors, application behaviour, and performance results. I will introduce LiveLabs, a 5 year project that started at the Singapore Management University in early 2012. The goal of LiveLabs is to convert real environments, such as the entire Singapore Management University campus, a popular resort island, and a large convention centre, into living testbeds where we instrument both the environment and the cell phones of opted-in participants (drawn from the student population and members of the public). I will describe the broad LiveLabs vision and identify the key research challenges and opportunities. I will then talk about our current implementations at various venues and share the insights and lessons we have learned from them. In particular, I will highlight our current insights into indoor location tracking, dynamic group and queue detection, and energy aware context sensing for mobile phones. I will also share our current status and some of the non-obvious challenges that arise from deploying these systems in real environments. Finally, I will discuss how the global research community can use LiveLabs to test innovations in mobile sensing, analytics, applications, and interventions.

He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University and has over 15 years of research experience in the broad area of mobile systems and software. Some of the diverse areas that he has worked on include infrastructure support for multiplayer mobile games, improvements to public transportation networks, understanding and improving the software development process in outsourced environments, power management for mobile displays and sensing, and developing and testing novel human-centric mobile applications. Rajesh is also a director of the LiveLabs Urban LifeStyle Innovation Platform. The goal of this platform is to allow mobile sensing, analytics, applications and services to be tested with real users on real phones in real-world environments. Currently, LiveLabs has been deployed at a university campus, a resort island, and a large convention centre.

                                                            <strong>Abstract: </strong>Electrical substations are crucial for power grids. A number of international standards, such as IEC 60870 and 61850, have emerged to enable remote and automated control over substations. However, owing to insufficient security consideration in their design and implementation, the resulting systems could be vulnerable to cyber attacks. As a result, the modernization of a large number of substations dramatically increases the scale of potential damage successful attacks can cause on power grids. To counter such a risk, one promising direction is to design and deploy an additional layer of defence at the substations. However, it remains a challenge to evaluate various substation cybersecurity solutions in a realistic environment. We present the design and implementation of SoftGrid, a software-based smart grid testbed for evaluating the effectiveness, performance, and interoperability of various security solutions implemented to protect the remote control interface of substations. We then discuss a concrete case study evaluating a security-enhanced substation gateway prototype.</p>

We are now working on a project funded by NRF to develop cyber-physical security solutions to protect urban transportation systems. To validate the viability of those security solutions, a customized testbed is essential to the success of the project. In this talk, I will share the experience on how to set up such a testbed to meet the project requirement, and what experiments will be carried out on the testbed.</p>

Looking ahead, to drive its long-term research agenda -- ensuring future generations will continue to reap the benefits of fundamental S&E research — NSF has identified a set of 10 "big ideas.” These ideas capitalize on what NSF does best: catalyze interest and investment in fundamental research, which is the basis for discovery, invention and innovation. One such big idea focuses on the future role of mid-scale research infrastructure.<br/><br/>

NSF S&E activities rely increasingly on infrastructure that is diverse in space, cost and implementation time - everything from major observatories to nationwide sensor networks to smaller experiments. NSF funds small - and mid-scale research infrastructure projects -- up to $20 million -- through its individual scientific directorates. I will discuss the Computing, Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate's current investments in mid-scale computing and networking research infrastructure, including research platforms such as the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), the Parallel Reconfigurable Observational Environment (PRObE), and NSFFutureCloud’s Chameleon and CloudLab systems. I will explain synergies between these infrastructures, and a vision of NSF `super-facilities’ that leverage federation, identity management and highly flexible, deeply programmable and sliceable resources.
