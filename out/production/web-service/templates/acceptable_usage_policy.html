<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reservations of resources for cyber exercises by the government agencies could be made 12 months in advance. &nbsp;Due to the nature of teaching/training classes by AU, RI and IHL, reservations of resources for such activities could be made 12 months in advance as well, but up to 10 nodes for 36 hours. &nbsp;Reservations for all other activities could be made 6 months in advance.</span>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reservation should also be made at least one month in advance. &nbsp;This is to give some of the users running existing experiments sufficient time to conclude their work. &nbsp;Further, as the Resource Allocation Meeting is held monthly on the third work day of each month, and the resource allocation confirmed on the fifth work day, the following reservations are not allowed:</span>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users may make short-term bookings of the resources less than one month but more than three days in advance, or use the resources on an ad-hoc basis without any reservation or booking. &nbsp;The three-day gap is to allow administrators to have sufficient time to inform existing users and close experiments that clash with the booking. These bookings/usages will be processed in a first-come-first-serve basis. &nbsp;Cancellation is not allowed and the user will be charged the full amount. &nbsp;Further, if a short-term booking, or an experiment from such booking, is in conflict with a reservation, NCL may request users to terminate the short-term booking or experiment. &nbsp; A note on upcoming booking status will be prompted to alert users about potential conflict in booking. Users will be given the full refund of the unused resources.</span>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Appendix 1</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The derivation of the pricing formula is as follows.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setup and operational cost of NCL broadly consists of the following components:</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(1) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of testbed hardware and software;</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(2) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manpower cost of running the testbed;</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(3) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utility cost of running the hardware;</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(4) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of enhancing the testbed (including manpower, hardware and software)</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the testbed is setup, for NCL to continue operating without further enhancement, only the costs in Items (2) and (3) are required. &nbsp;That is to say, in order to ensure that enough revenue is generated in the long run, NCL will need to generate revenue to cover the cost of Items (2) and (3). </span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming further, for simplicity, that the utilization rate of the testbed remains constant at steady state of operations, and that there is no inflation, at every phase of operations, NCL will need to recover the cost incurred for Items (2) and (3). </span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct cost, DC, of using 1 node for 1 hour (inclusive of utility cost) is therefore equal to</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Utility cost per hour + (Total manpower cost of running NCL for 3 years)/(Number of computing hours utilized in 3 years)</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">= Utility cost per hour + (Total manpower cost of running NCL for 3 years)/(300 nodes&times;24 hours &times;365 days&times;3 years&times;% utilization)</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance to the charging model used by NUS, there will be an additional 20% of indirect cost being charged. &nbsp;In other words, the cost of using 1 node for 1 hour is equal to 1.2 &times;
    DC.</span></p>
